# PRL @ AAAI 2025

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA  \

## Aim and Scope

While AI Planning and Reinforcement Learning communities focus on similar
sequential decision-making problems, these communities remain somewhat unaware
of each other on specific problems, techniques, methodologies, and evaluations.

This workshop aims to encourage discussion and collaboration between researchers in the fields of AI planning and reinforcement learning. 
We aim to bridge the gap between the two communities, facilitate the discussion of differences and similarities in existing techniques, and encourage collaboration across the fields. 
We solicit interest from AI researchers that work in the
intersection of planning and reinforcement learning, in particular, those that focus on intelligent decision-making. This is the eigth edition of the [PRL workshop series](https://prl-theworkshop.github.io/) that started at [ICAPS 2020](https://icaps20subpages.icaps-conference.org/workshops/prl/).

## Submission Details


We solicit workshop paper submissions relevant to the above call of the following types:

 * Long papers -- up to 8 pages + unlimited references / appendices
 * Short papers -- up to 4 pages + unlimited references / appendices
 * Extended abstracts -- up to 2 pages + unlimited references/appendices 
 

Papers must be formatted in AAAI two-column; see the [AAAI-25 author kit for details](https://aaai.org/authorkit25/).  Authors submitting papers rejected from other conferences, please ensure you do your utmost to address the comments given by the reviewers. ~~Please do not submit papers that are already accepted for the main AAAI conference to the workshop.~~ Given the timeline, we welcome papers under review at the AAAI main conference. We request the authors to inform us if the paper is accepted at AAAI, when the decisions are out.

Some accepted long papers will be invited for contributed talks. All other accepted papers (long and short) and accepted extended abstracts will be given a slot in the poster presentation session.  Extended abstracts are intended as brief summaries of already published papers,  preliminary work, position papers, or challenges that might help bridge the gap.

As the main purpose of this workshop is to solicit discussion, the authors are
invited to use the appendix of their submissions for that purpose.


Paper submissions should be made through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=AAAI.org/2025/Workshop/PRL).

We do not insist on papers being submitted anonymously initially; this decision is left to the discretion of the author. If a paper is simultaneously being considered at a venue where anonymity is required, you have the option to submit it without author details, considering the possibility of a shared reviewer pool. However, please be aware that upon acceptance, the paper will be publicly posted on the PRL website with full author information.
