## Aim and Scope

While *AI Planning* and *Reinforcement Learning* communities focus on similar
sequential decision-making problems, these communities remain somewhat unaware
of each other on specific problems, techniques, methodologies, and evaluations.

This workshop aims to encourage discussion and collaboration between researchers in the fields of AI planning and (reinforcement) learning. 
We aim to bridge the gap between the two communities, facilitate the discussion of differences and similarities in existing techniques, and encourage collaboration across the fields. 
We solicit interest from AI researchers that work in the
intersection of planning and (reinforcement) learning, in particular, those that focus on intelligent decision-making. This is the ninth edition of the [PRL workshop series](https://prl-theworkshop.github.io/) that started at [ICAPS 2020](https://icaps20subpages.icaps-conference.org/workshops/prl/).

PRL aims to coordinate with the workshops *Reliability In Planning and Learning* (RIPL) and *Language Models for Planning* (LM4Plan), with PRL covering the general intersection of learning and planning, RIPL covering the reliability-related aspects and LM4Plan covering the language model-related aspects of these areas. Joint sessions across workshops are a possibility that we will evaluate depending on submissions and workshop timing.
## Topics of Interest

We invite submissions at the intersection of AI Planning and (reinforcement) Learning. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following

* Reinforcement learning (model-based, Bayesian, deep, hierarchical, etc.)
* Learning for planning (L4P)
* Generalized planning
* Monte Carlo planning
* Model representation
* Model learning
* Planning using approximated/uncertain (learned) models
* Learning search heuristics for planner guidance
* Theoretical aspects of planning and reinforcement learning
* Dataset and Benchmarks across planning and RL
* Action policy analysis or certification
* Reinforcement learning and planning competition(s)
* Multi-agent planning and learning
* Applications of both (reinforcement) learning and planning


## Important Dates

* Paper submission deadline: August 1, AOE
* Paper acceptance notification: August 31, AOE

ICAPS will be **in-person** this year. Authors of accepted workshop papers are expected to physically attend the conference and present in person.

<!-- ## Schedule


# Program



## Keynotes 

## Talks 
Select accepted papers are given a slot in the program: 15 minutes for content + 3 minutes for questions.

## Poster Sessions
The program includes two poster sessions in order to have enough time for discussions. All authors are expected to participate in the poster session.

## Submission Details


We solicit workshop paper submissions relevant to the above call of the following types:

 * Long papers -- up to 8 pages + unlimited references / appendices
 * Short papers -- up to 4 pages + unlimited references / appendices
 * Extended abstracts -- up to 2 pages + unlimited references/appendices 
 
Please format submissions in ICAPS style (see instructions in the [Author Kit](https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/files/icaps2025-author-kit.zip)). Authors submitting papers rejected from other conferences, please ensure you do your utmost to address the comments given by the reviewers. Please do not submit papers that are already accepted for the main ICAPS conference to the workshop. 
As this workshop is non-archival, you may submit already accepted papers from other conferences if they fit the workshops's scope. 

Some accepted long papers will be invited for contributed talks and potentially also a slot in the poster presentation session. 
<!-- ~~All accepted papers (long as well as short) and extended abstracts will be given a slot in the poster presentation session.~~  -->
All other accepted papers (long and short) and accepted extended abstracts will be given a slot in the poster presentation session. 
Extended abstracts are intended as brief summaries of already published papers,  preliminary work, position papers, or challenges that might help bridge the gap.

As the main purpose of this workshop is to solicit discussion, the authors are invited to use the appendix of their submissions for that purpose.


Paper submissions should be made through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=icaps-conference.org/ICAPS/2025/Workshop/PRL).

We do not insist on papers being submitted anonymously initially; this decision is left to the discretion of the author. If a paper is simultaneously being considered at a venue where anonymity is required, you have the option to submit it without author details, considering the possibility of a shared reviewer pool. However, please be aware that upon acceptance, the paper will be publicly posted on the PRL website with full author information.
